Single SPA in Create React App
==============================

A simple example of a Create React App based application using SystemJS to import a parcel and to place that parcel on the page.

# Install and Run

For the Test parcel

```sh
% cd test-parcel
% yarn
% yarn watch
```

For the home (host) page. In another shell:

```sh
% cd home
% yarn
% yarn start
```
